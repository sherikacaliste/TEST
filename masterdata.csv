That is very important. I would also like to see job training programs. Buffalo Public Schools have proven that more money does not significantly fix problematic schools. Burgard, Mckinley and East are literal jails for these kids. So I think the money would be better allocated to job training programs which can actually provide the experience needed to earn an income.","Housing!!!!!!!!!! Safe housing is a human right. Evictions are at an all time high. Homeless shelters are overwhelmed. The rental prices are disproportionate to the quality of the homes and income levels of tenants.","I don't really understand the question. I don't really feel safe anywhere. But I feel more safe in Buffalo over other cities because I have had family here my whole life and generally if you mind your business you stay out of trouble. Our police are useless. I guess the non profits help make it feel more safe. But I generally am not concerned with safety. The world is dangerous and I dont expect anyone to protect me but myself. ","The police, the city government, the county government, the dozen white supremist groups, South Buffalo, Byron Brown, Mark Poloncarz, 80% of the County Legislators, people living in million dollar homes less than two miles away from the Jefferson Tops, the list is honestly endless. Its not unique to Buffalo but all systems are meant to alienate. ","Another endless list. Honestly I feel like fixing the problems here aren't hard people are just assholes and cant give the tiniest bit for people to have basic needs met.

More green space, community gardens and urban farms.
Less restrictions on agricultural zoning in the city
It would be really cool if there was an incentive for communities to provide their own needs, instead of relying on the city and county. I feel like non profits play a huge role here. The issue is not having enough people willing to do the work, the issue is all the barriers these people face which causes rapid burn out. We just need a government that is more willing to pass the torch to younger generations and try new things. Its ok if a new idea has tons of holes and doesnt work out. When problems arise we can handle those problems. I find it so stupid that instead of trying new things because of the backlash we just do nothing and these problems become unfixable.","I stay active in my community, I work to help people in my community and I teach my child to love everyone and stand up against injustice.
